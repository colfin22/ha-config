"""Persists a history of completed updates -- entity, old version, new
version, when, and release notes -- so Phase 2's panel has something to show
under its "History" tab (see FUTURE.md). This is genuinely new data only
Update Manager creates, unlike coordinator.py's ready/waiting/blocked status
(a live recomputation of HA's own update-entity state, never stored), so
unlike that one this does need real persistent storage. No entity: a
growing, unbounded history list doesn't belong in an entity's state/attribute
footprint, and the intended reader is the future panel's websocket_api call,
not the state machine.
