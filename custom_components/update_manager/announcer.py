"""Pure logic for auto-install's "announce, don't just install" behaviour.
No `homeassistant` imports, following the same pure-logic-first pattern as
semver.py/staging.py
-- independently testable, and importable via the same importlib trick the
existing tests use, bypassing pytest-homeassistant-custom-component.

An update reaching "ready" (staging.py) with auto-install enabled for its
size (small/medium/large, see semver.py) doesn't get installed immediately:
it's announced first, with a fixed, cancellable wait before
install_manager.py actually calls `update.install`. This module only
decides *what should happen right now* for one entity; it owns no state
and does no I/O itself.

    trusted voter's already-aggregated verdict for this exact pending
    version, if any (see community_verdict.py's own async_get_verdict for
    how a list of trusted usernames' individual votes becomes this single
    value -- this function only ever sees the result, never the raw list),
    and (b) the wider crowd's own raw problematic count. Direct user
    feedback, 2026-07-23 ("installeer altijd automatisch als [klaptafel]
    een update als healthy heeft beoordeeld, ongeacht mijn eigen rules" ->
    confirmed symmetric while planning: a trusted "problematic" verdict
    blocks just as firmly).

    auto_install_excluded (Core/Supervisor/OS, plus anything the user
    explicitly excluded) is a hard, unconditional gate either way -- a
    trusted "healthy" vote never reaches past it, exactly like the size
    toggle never does today. So is an explicit user skip (status ==
    "skipped"): found by review, a bare trusted-healthy override that
    ignored status entirely would silently un-skip a version the user
    deliberately told Home Assistant to skip via update.skip, the moment
    someone they trust rated it healthy -- a direct, deliberate user action
    outranks an indirect trust setting, same reasoning as
    auto_install_excluded. `installable` isn't a parameter here at all:
    that's still install_manager.py's own separate, always-applies gate
    (announcer.py has never known about it, decide_action takes it as its
    own argument), unaffected by any of this.

    A trusted "healthy" vote overrides *both* the size-based toggle and the
    staging wait period (`is_ready`) for anything else -- the whole point of
    naming someone more trusted than your own rules is that their
    judgement can skip the wait, not just the toggle -- and it wins even
    when community_problematic_count is nonzero: direct user feedback,
    2026-07-29, when asked whether a stray untrusted problematic report
    should override a trusted healthy vote -- a trusted voter's own
    judgment should count for something, otherwise trusting them at all is
    pointless. So this check comes first, unconditionally.

    Only once there's no trusted-healthy override in play does
    community_problematic_count matter: any problematic vote at all, from
    anyone, however small a minority, blocks eligibility outright -- no
    quorum, no percentage, the same asymmetric-safety reasoning already
    applied elsewhere (quorum only ever mattered for trusting the crowd
    enough to force an install, a feature that doesn't exist yet; blocking
    needs no quorum, since erring towards caution is always the safe
    direction). This subsumes the old,
    narrower "a trusted voter's own problematic vote blocks" rule: a
    trusted voter's problematic vote is itself already counted inside the
    aggregate community_problematic_count, so that case no longer needs its
    own separate branch. Neither this nor the trusted-healthy override
    changes how decide_action itself sequences announce/execute -- only
    what feeds into it."""

    - "announce": start a new cancellable countdown.
    - "execute": the countdown elapsed uncancelled -- actually install now.
    - "remove": an announcement exists but no longer applies (rule turned
      off, update resolved itself/changed/disappeared, or the user
      cancelled this exact target version) -- clear it, no user action
      needed, only a real cancel needs a manual dismiss.
    - "none": nothing to do.

    Deliberately sequential, not overlapping: the announcement only starts
    once staging.py's own status is actually "ready" (is_ready=True), never
    earlier. An overlapping design (start announcing once the remaining
    uitsteltermijn drops to announce_wait, before status flips to "ready")
    was tried and reverted (2026-07-17, direct user feedback): a "waiting"
    entity that already had an active cancel countdown running underneath
    it read as self-contradictory in the UI, and wasn't explainable to
    users in one sentence. Total time from "available" to "installed" is
    now plainly uitsteltermijn + aankondigingstermijn, matching what a user
    reading those two settings would expect.

    master_enabled (the global pause switch, const.py's CONF_ENABLED) is
    deliberately its own parameter, not folded into auto_install_enabled --
    while paused, an existing announcement is frozen in place (this
    function returns "none", touching nothing at all) rather than removed,
    so resuming continues the *same* countdown from the *same* execute_at
    instead of restarting a fresh announce_wait from whenever the switch
    happened to flip back on. Direct user feedback (2026-07-17), after
    seeing an in-flight countdown jump forward by a full announce_wait the
    moment the pause switch was toggled off and back on. auto_install_enabled
    turning off for a real reason (the size's own rule, exclusion, or the
    entity losing INSTALL support) still removes the announcement as before
    -- that is a genuine, lasting change in disposition, not a pause.
