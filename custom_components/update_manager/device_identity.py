"""HA-dependent counterpart to hacs_identity.py's pure resolve_identity: looks
up an update entity's device_registry/entity_registry entries and turns
them into the is_hacs_entity/device_manufacturer/device_model/app_slug
arguments resolve_identity expects, for everything that needs a real hass
(confirming an entity is actually HACS-owned, plus the devices/apps
categories). Kept out of hacs_identity.py itself so that module stays free
of any homeassistant import (see its own docstring).

Verified against home-assistant/core's stable release tag 2026.7.3 (not
dev), homeassistant/components/hassio/entity.py: HassioAddonEntity sets
DeviceInfo(identifiers={(DOMAIN, addon.addon.slug)}) with hassio's own
DOMAIN ("hassio"), directly embedding the add-on slug in the device
registry. The same DOMAIN is also used, with fixed literal values (not real
slugs), by Core/Supervisor/OS/host/mount's own hassio-side devices
(HassioCoreEntity et al, same file) -- those three update entities are
already claimed by hacs_identity.py's fixed entity_id map before this
module is ever consulted, but _NOT_A_REAL_ADDON_SLUG guards against it
defensively anyway, in case that map ever misses a case.

"hassio" is hardcoded here rather than imported from
homeassistant.components.hassio.const: that component isn't installed at
all on a Core-only (non-Supervisor) install, so importing it would break
this module there. Same reasoning zigbee.py already uses for hardcoding
"zha" instead of importing homeassistant.components.zha.
