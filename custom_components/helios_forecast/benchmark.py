"""Opt-in upload of what this installation predicted, for the public accuracy benchmark.

A forecast can only be judged against what actually happened, and a prediction nobody
recorded at the moment it was made cannot be reconstructed afterwards: no provider serves
its own past emissions. So the only way to ever prove a model is right is to write down,
hour after hour, what it announced before reality had a say. That is all this does. Once an
hour it posts the curve this entry currently predicts, together with the production already
measured, and an external collector scores the two against each other once the day is over.

Off unless switched on, and switched on is the whole of it: there is no key to ask for and none
to keep. What it sends is fixed and deliberately small: the geometry of the installation, the
predicted curve with the cloud cover behind it, the measured production and the reliability index.
No entity names, no consumption, no other sensor, nothing about the rest of the house. Coordinates
are rounded to two decimals, roughly a kilometre, which no weather model can tell apart and which
keeps a street address out of the upload. The site is identified by a hash of the config entry,
which Home Assistant generates when the integration is added and which survives restarts, updates,
reconfigurations and backups. So the collector can follow one installation over time without ever
being told whose it is, and without anybody having to carry a credential around.

The upload runs beside the refresh, never inside it: it cannot delay a forecast, and any
failure (server down, no network, a refused version) is dropped after a debug line. A missed hour is
a missing row in someone's benchmark, never a broken integration.
