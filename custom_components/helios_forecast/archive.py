"""The integration's own long-term statistics: the metadata they carry, and the one-time move of
the series that used to be written under an entity id.

Home Assistant knows two kinds of statistics. A series named after an entity belongs to the
recorder, which compiles it from that entity's state every hour on its own. A series named
``<domain>:<object_id>`` belongs to the integration that declares it, and the recorder never
touches it. Everything this integration archives is of the second kind, because it is written from
here: the past weather hours Open-Meteo only serves for 60 days, and the predicted-production curve
the card draws behind today.

Until 2026.9.5 those series were written under the entity ids of the weather sensors and of two
archive sensors, which put the recorder and this integration on the same unique index. A collision
there does not fail our write alone: it rolls back the recorder's entire hourly compile, so every
other integration on the machine silently loses that hour of history. `async_migrate` moves the
history off those entity ids once and for all, and never deletes anything it has not first checked
it could read back somewhere else.

It runs once Home Assistant has finished starting, never during setup. The recorder waits for that
same event before it processes its queue, so anything here that waits on a recorder write while the
start is still in progress waits on a start that is waiting on it.
