"""DataUpdateCoordinator: fetch Open-Meteo + recorder history and build the forecast.

Runs the model on a timer, holding the assembled points and the derived summary.
One combined Open-Meteo fetch per refresh (60 past days for the learning, 7 future
days for the forecast), regardless of how many panel orientations are configured;
the model splits that single weather series across orientations itself. The learned
residual map is built from the recorder's own production / SoC history.
