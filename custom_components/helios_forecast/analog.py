"""Analog-ensemble forecast refinement.

Instead of trusting a generic physical model, look up past hours whose conditions
(sun geometry + cloud cover) resemble the hour being forecast, and read what the
installation ACTUALLY produced then, as a ratio to what the physical model said for
those same hours. The median ratio applied to today's physics is a site-calibrated
point forecast (it carries the real shading, soiling, orientation error and inverter
behaviour), and the 10th/90th percentile ratios give a data-driven uncertainty band.

Ratios rather than watts because an analog is never at exactly today's sun position:
the nearest past hours at a September morning's altitude sit at a more northerly
azimuth in July, where a south roof made less. Read as watts, those analogs pulled
the forecast down by half on clear mornings across the fleet; read as ratios, the
geometry difference is the physics' business and the analog only says how the site
departs from it. Watts remain the fallback when no physics is available for the
history (no layout, or a model too small to divide by).

This refines the physical model rather than replacing it: when few close analogs
exist (cold start, unusual conditions) the prediction blends back toward the
physical value by confidence, so the forecast degrades gracefully.

Pure functions, no Home Assistant. Production buckets are the ProductionBucket
of solar/residual.py, and the ratio side needs the whole PV power model, not the
sun geometry alone: it compares the meter against what the model said for that
same hour, inverter cap included.
